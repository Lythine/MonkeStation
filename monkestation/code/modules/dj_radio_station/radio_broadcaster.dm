### Pirate Radio Broadcaster
X Cost Machine, limit one
Allows the DJ to broadcast back to the station, no matter the location,
 (works like a tcomms link) and gives the DJ the ability to make special announcements on a longer delay than the regular station console gets.

Has a GPS signal that could allow for security to track down the radio station.
